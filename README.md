### Machine Learning  

#### **Census Data Income Prediction**  
- **Objective:** Developed a machine learning model to predict whether an adult earns more than $50K per year based on U.S. census data.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Explored demographic and economic features (age, education, occupation, etc.).  
  - Trained multiple classifiers:  
    - Logistic Regression  
    - Support Vector Machine  
    - Gradient Boosting  
    - K-Nearest Neighbors  
    - Decision Tree  
    - Random Forest  
    - Neural Network  
  - Applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.  
- **Results:**  
  - Achieved an **accuracy of 88%** with Gradient Boosting, outperforming other models.  
  - Identified key income-influencing factors such as education level and occupation.  
- **Tools & Technologies:** `Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras, Matplotlib, Plotly, XGBoost`
