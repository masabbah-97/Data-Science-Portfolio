### Machine Learning  

#### **[Census Data Income Prediction](https://github.com/masabbah-97/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Census-Data-Income-Prediction)**  
- **Objective:** Developed a machine learning model to predict whether an adult earns more than $50K per year based on U.S. census data.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Explored demographic and economic features (age, education, occupation, etc.).  
  - Trained multiple classifiers:  
    - Logistic Regression  
    - Support Vector Machine  
    - Gradient Boosting  
    - K-Nearest Neighbors  
    - Decision Tree  
    - Random Forest  
    - Neural Network  
  - Applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.  
- **Results:**  
  - Achieved an **accuracy of 88%** with Gradient Boosting, outperforming other models.  
  - Identified key income-influencing factors such as education level and occupation.  
- **Tools & Technologies:** `Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras, Matplotlib, Plotly, XGBoost`
#### **[Insurance Charge Prediction](https://github.com/masabbah-97/Insurance-Charge-Prediction)**  
- **Objective:** Developed models to predict individual insurance charges based on demographic and health-related features.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Explored demographic features (age, sex, region, etc.) and health-related features (BMI, smoking, etc.).  
  - Applied **Frequentist** and **Bayesian** approaches:  
    - Linear Regression  
    - Polynomial Features (for non-linear relationships)  
  - In the **Frequentist Approach**, models were evaluated using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** to assess prediction accuracy.  
  - In the **Bayesian Approach**, model evaluation included:
    - **Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)** for model fit comparison.  
    - **Potential Scale Reduction Factor (RÌ‚)** to check MCMC convergence.  
    - **Effective Sample Size (n.eff.)** to measure independence in samples.  
    - **RMSE** for model accuracy.  
- **Results:**  
  - Both Frequentist and Bayesian models performed well, with polynomial features enhancing model performance.  
  - The model with polynomial features provided lower **DIC** and better **RMSE** scores.  
  - Identified significant variables like **age**, **BMI**, and **smoking** as key predictors of insurance charges.  
- **Tools & Technologies:** `R, JAGS, caret, ggplot2, R2jags, Metrics, dplyr, nortest, reshape2, e1071, gridExtra, knitr`
